# APIs Level Two Microchallenge


## What is a micro-challenge?
- A micro-challenge is a small task or project designed to be completed within a specific time frame. It promotes learning through hands-on coding experience. This micro-challenge's purpose is to help you practice data preparation and visualization using Python and the **Iris dataset**. If you aren’t familiar with these concepts, our Level One walkthrough is a great place to start.
