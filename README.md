# APIs Level Two Microchallenge


## What is a micro-challenge?
- A micro-challenge is a small task or project designed to be completed within a specific time frame. It promotes learning through hands-on coding experience. This micro-challenge's purpose is to help you practice data preparation and visualization using Python and the **Iris dataset**. If you aren’t familiar with these concepts, our Level One walkthrough is a great place to start.

## Difficulty = ★☆☆

## What you will build:
- A simple Pokedex using the public PokeAPI

## How you will build it:
- Identify the PokeAPI endpoint
- Ask the user to enter a Pokemon name input

- Check if the request was successful
- Print data about the Pokemon

## Duration:
- less than a day
